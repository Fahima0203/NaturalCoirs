            Coco peat, also known as coir pith, coir fibre pith, coir dust, or simply coir, is a by-product 
            of de-fabricated coconut husks from Coir Industries. Coir pith is an ideal soil re-conditioner, 
            soil structure improver and soil substrate with excellent water holding capacity.<br /><br />
            We at Ultimate Coco's manufacture and market Coco Peat / Coir pith Briquettes in two sizes, 
            5kg Blocks and 650gram Bricks according to customer's requirement. Coir Pith / Coco peat is washed, 
            heat-treated, screened and graded before being processed into coco peat products of various granularity 
            and density. Also used mostly in food waste treatment plant to cover them in to compost.<br /><br />

            These 25 kg bales are 2:1 compressed coco peat which expand to 180 to 200 lts. These bales are easily broken 
            for usage due to low compression. Specifically designed for farming, gardening and seed production. These 
            bags serve as exceptional soil conditioners, offering a wide range of advantages for plant growth and 
            development. Usually these bales are compressed with about 40% moisture which is ready to use in gardens.

            They are designed to be used as a growing medium for plants, particularly in seed starting and propagation. 
            When soaked in water, these discs expand significantly, providing a lightweight and porous substrate that retains moisture while allowing for good drainage.<br /><br />
            Coir discs are an eco-friendly alternative to traditional peat moss and other growing media. They are biodegradable, 
            sustainable, and provide a natural environment for plant roots to thrive. These discs are often used in hydroponics, 
            container gardening, and as a soil amendment to improve aeration and water retention.<br /><br />
            Coir discs are used in the horticulture when the customer is likely to use plastic pots of different diameter and volume.
            Universally to match with such demands we do manufacture coir discs (coins) with various diameters like 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 80 & 100 mm and 100 x1 00 square as well. 
            Their expanded volume can be changed according to the buyer’s specification. Below we have given the description table for the various coins and plugs. 
            These values can slightly vary with buyer’s need and it could be easily met by us.
            Normally these coco peat material used in coins will be double screened to remove any fines and fibre to provide optimal rooting. 
            Also the EC value can be reduced below 0.3 ms/cm in special orders.
