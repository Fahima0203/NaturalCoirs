    //         soil structure improver and soil substrate with excellent water holding capacity.<br /><br />
    //         We at Ultimate Coco's manufacture and market Coco Peat / Coir pith Briquettes in two sizes, 
    //         5kg Blocks and 650gram Bricks according to customer's requirement. Coir Pith / Coco peat is washed, 
    //         heat-treated, screened and graded before being processed into coco peat products of various granularity 
    //         and density. Also used mostly in food waste treatment plant to cover them in to compost.<br /><br />

            Coco Peat is available as Natural (regular), Washed and Buffered (Calcium Nitrate Treated) Material.

            This compression is done for the convenience of transportation. 
            Coco peat has an unique future to with stand high compaction without changing its properties. 
            When one Kg of this block is hydrated with 4 liters of water, you get a yield of upto 18 liters and above. 
            So, approximately you will get upto 85 liters of yield from a 5 Kg coco peat block, which can be mixed with soil

            Coir Fibre is a natural fiber extracted from the outer husk of coconuts. It is known for its durability, 
            water resistance, and biodegradability, making it an ideal material for various applications.<br /><br />
            Coir Fibre is used in products like ropes, mats, brushes, and horticultural applications due to its strength 
            and resistance to saltwater. It is also used in erosion control mats and as a growing medium in gardening.<br /><br />
            Coir Fibre is extracted from the outer shell of the coconut (coconut husk) using decodicator method.<br /><br />
            It has high lignin content and thus low cellulose content, as a result of which it is resilient, strong and highly durable. 
            Coir fibre is used to make twine, doormats, brushes, garden articles, geo textiles, rugs, mattress, pith or peat, automobile upholsters, 
            packaging, insulations and more. We process both White (from fresh green husk) & Brown Fiber (from dried brown husk) in our facility.<br /><br />
            Coconut coir fiber is a natural fiber extracted from the husk of coconuts. It is a coarse and fibrous 
            material that serves various purposes in gardening, agriculture, and other applications.
