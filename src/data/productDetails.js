    //         Coco peat, also known as coir pith, coir fibre pith, coir dust, or simply coir, is a by-product 
    //         of de-fabricated coconut husks from Coir Industries. Coir pith is an ideal soil re-conditioner, 
    //         soil structure improver and soil substrate with excellent water holding capacity.<br /><br />
    //         We at Ultimate Coco's manufacture and market Coco Peat / Coir pith Briquettes in two sizes, 
    //         5kg Blocks and 650gram Bricks according to customer's requirement. Coir Pith / Coco peat is washed, 
    //         heat-treated, screened and graded before being processed into coco peat products of various granularity 
    //         and density. Also used mostly in food waste treatment plant to cover them in to compost.<br /><br />
