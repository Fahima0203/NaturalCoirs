            This compression is done for the convenience of transportation. 
            Coco peat has an unique future to with stand high compaction without changing its properties. 
            When one kg of this block is hydrated with 3lts of water, you get a yield of 15 lts and above.

            Coir Fibre is extracted from the outer shell of the coconut (coconut husk) using decodicator method.<br /><br />
            It has high lignin content and thus low cellulose content, as a result of which it is resilient, strong and highly durable. 
            Coir fibre is used to make twine, doormats, brushes, garden articles, geo textiles, rugs, mattress, pith or peat, automobile upholsters, 
            packaging, insulations and more. We process both White (from fresh green husk) & Brown Fiber (from dried brown husk) in our facility.<br /><br />
