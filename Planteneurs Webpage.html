    <h2>What is Cocopeat?</h2>
    <p>Cocopeat, also known as coir pith or coir dust, is a 100% organic, biodegradable, and renewable by-product derived from coconut husks. It is widely recognized as a superior alternative to soil or peat moss, offering high porosity, excellent water-holding capacity, and optimal air circulation. These unique features make cocopeat ideal for seed germination, hydroponics, nursery plantations, and large-scale agriculture.</p>
    <br>
</section>
<section id="products" class="container"></section>
    <b><p>We offer a wide range of cocopeat varieties:</p></b>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>High EC</b> ‚Äì ideal for specific industrial or non-agricultural uses.</li>
        <li><b>Low EC</b> ‚Äì perfect for sensitive crops and food production.</li>
        <li><b>Washed Cocopeat</b> ‚Äì free from excess salts, ideal for vegetables and fruits.</li>
